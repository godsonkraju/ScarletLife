                    <em>Once upon a time...</em>
                    </br></br>
                    Humans inhabited Planet Earth, advancing in sorts of sciences and technologies. Mike, one of the
                    most intelligent of them all, loved to experiment to make benevolent species. However, the leaders
                    of all the nations were weary of his actions. They restricted his experiments in their lands, but instead
                    built him an island, Oluwaseyi, at which he could run his laboratories. Little did they know, he could
                    build the most dangerous specie that may destroy the entire Universe. As Mike was outside drinking
                    water out of a coconut on the beach one warm summer day, Mike's cat spilled chemical BN89 into MN01.
                    That is the most lethal accident to have been recorded since the Big Bang happened. BN89 + MN01 formed the
                    most dangerous specie known, SL0x52, or <em>Scarlet Life</em>. Scarlet Life is a massive and unpredictable
                    specie that can immediately kill you depending on how long you stay in contact. However, BN89 is the
                    <em>Good Life</em>, that can take on Scarlet Life. In a matter of 2 days, Scarlet Life took over the entire
                    Planet Earth and all the inhabitants were forced to evacuate via a spaceship. Mike knows of a
                    a safe haven immune to Scarlet Life. However, we must travel trillions of miles into another dimension
                    and we are very limited on fuel, spaceship's health, and bullets. We must make stops in other galaxies
                    throughout our journey to refuel, repair, and pick up supplies. Sometimes, the aliens of those planets
                    are nice enough to leave supplies to refuel and repair our spaceship mid-flight. Others, require that
                    we crack their code to prove that we cause no harm. We must collect keys to crack the code before we can land
                    in their territory. You will be our pilot, in control of our movements and bullet firing. Oh
                    yea...who am I? I'm the artificial intelligence that Mike had programmed. Before Mike could finish
                    programming me, the accident happened. Darn. Hence, I can only guide you, but only you may fly the spaceship!
